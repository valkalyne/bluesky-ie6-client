## instructions

u need somesort of webserver to run this on and something like [WebOne](https://github.com/atauenis/webone) to make Functional requests on IE7 and prior..

you'll also have to enable accessing data sources across domains in inetcpl (Internet Options) in IE9 and prior!!!

if u were wondering it works a Lot Better in Modern Browsers ...
